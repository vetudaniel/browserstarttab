# Custom Browser Landing Page

Hey guys this is a basic custom webbrowser landing page i've been working on last weekend

I'm new to webdevelopement and this is just for practice purposes.

Feel free to make any changes if you would like to improve it.

## How it works

Everytime you open your browser you get a random backgroundimage

a random quote, the time , date and weather plus some useful links

uses fontawesome, some skeleton button and openweathermap weather api

# How to make it your own

- You will need your own weather api from <https://openweathermap.org/>
- Edit the links to your liking
- Change the city to your city
- You will need to change the name to your own for the greeting
- You have to set your google chrome startup page to the index.html

# Suggestions for changes 

- Make it fully responsive
- Add a todolist on the side(wanted to do this my own but I decided to move on)
- Make the background image change every 10-15 mins with a slide effect
- replace the hard coded quotes with some quotes api(if there is any)
- replace the hard coded backgroundimages with some external backgroundimages api (if there is any)
